## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture follows the **Medallion Architecture** with the **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
2. **Silver Layer**: Involves data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready data modeled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Creating fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Developing SQL-based reports and dashboards for insights.

🎯 This repository is ideal for professionals and students looking to showcase skills in:
- SQL Development  
- Data Architecture  
- Data Engineering  
- ETL Pipeline Development  
- Data Modeling  
- Data Analytics
